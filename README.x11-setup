need a minimal X server

We recommend to install a minimal X server by
USE="minimal xorg" emerge x11-base/xorg-server -a
Use-flag xorg is recommended!

It is not part of this README how to get a working X install.
Please refer for this to the depended xorg howto's.

Is your X server setup finished, it is easy to start your X server with
our provided init script /etc/init.d/vdr-x11.
We add by default minimal variables to the initscript to start the X server.

To fit your own setup, please refer to 'man xorg'

It is simple to add your own variables by using
/etc/conf.d/vdr  --> Variable X11_SERVER=
This will unset all default provided variables from the init script.
There are only variables to add, without to call the x11 lib /usr/bin/X !!!
