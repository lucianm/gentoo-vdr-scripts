* improve syslog parsing code

* eventually integrate settime

  (for example when calling "init 0")

  without starting vdr as daemon and connecting a client program

* Sort commands.conf files by user-preferences and not strictly alphabetically.
* Skip some commands.conf files or specific entries out of some files by
  special criteria.
* nice sperators between commands-files
* converting files from utf8 to latin1 if they happen to be in utf8
