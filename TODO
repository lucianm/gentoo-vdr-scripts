TODO file for gentoo-vdr-scripts

* Find out about acpi-problems

* eventually integrate settime

* writing time at system-shutdown without vdr having the power button
  (for example when calling "init 0")

* Create possibility to start vdr under x (for softdevice etc.)

* Sort commands.conf files by user-preferences and not strictly alphabetically.
* Skip some commands.conf files or specific entries out of some files by
  special criteria.

* Thread before shutdown - With possibility to plug in some addons
  This thread will be started when
    + it is sure it can do the shutdown (nothing is against it)
    + and it is an automatic shutdown (perhaps changed in future)
    + and this thread has not been finished in the last XXmin

  When decided not to run this thread
    shutdown continues
  else
    shutdown is aborted (with normal retry mechanism).
    
  This thread can do various things
    + do an epg-scan svdrp-SCAN or switch channel-ranges per CHAN)
    + fetch epg from external providers tvmovie hoerzu (when online)
    + fetch epg from infosat or nxtvepg
    + go over all recordings and start noad for those which have not had it already
    + trigger the xxv oder vdradmin autotimer
   
  This thread runs under a name for which is explicitly checked when shutdown so that
  it will not shutdown when it is not finished.
  It writes the time it finished into a file (perhaps under /var/vdr)

  When doing shutdown and the last finish-time read from file is not longer ago than XXmin
  then it will not be started again and shutdown continues.

* writing an API-document for all addon-scripts
  + plugin-rc-addons (run under root normally)
  + normal addons (root)
  + shutdown-checks (vdr)
  + wakeup-methods (root)
  + wait-functions (-)
