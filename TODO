TODO file for gentoo-vdr-scripts
$Id$

* eventually integrate settime

* writing time at system-shutdown without vdr having the power button
  (for example when calling "init 0")

* Create possibility to start vdr under x (for softdevice etc.)
  without starting vdr as daemon and connecting a client program

* Sort commands.conf files by user-preferences and not strictly alphabetically.
* Skip some commands.conf files or specific entries out of some files by
  special criteria.
* nice sperators between commands-files
* converting files from utf8 to latin1 if they happen to be in utf8

* writing an API-document for all addon-scripts
  + plugin-rc-addons (run under root normally)
  + normal addons (root)
  + wait-functions (-)

* rewrite shutdown-part

* documentation

* rewrite logging part, log more errors to special log-file

* make "/etc/init.d/vdr stop" execute the stop-addons for all loaded plugins
  even if list of plugins to load was changed while vdr is running.

* Cleanup positions of temporary files
